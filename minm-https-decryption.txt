Recent case study on HTTPS traffic interception. Breaking through traffic integrity by installing root certificate for windows machine. 

Once the root certificate is installed, cyber criminals perform MINM attack. Here is the following steps of interfiering the traffic from your local machine:

1. Localhost (client) sends the request to the server. Malicious certificate performs the HTTPS connection on behalf of the client (your machine).
2. After the connection is established, server sends back the data which will be recieved by malicious root certificate. Since the request was made on behalf of malicious
root cert, all data transmitted back to the infected machine is decrypted prior "reaching your browser window".
3. After fake certfificate was created, it impersonates the server certificate (created by malicious root CA)
4. Client establishes the TLS connection with the malicious certificate and sends the data to the client ( your browser )

What we have as the result:
All data sent back and forth is not encrypted, however the HTTPS lock appears and browser doesn't send the warning.
What it means for the user? Hacker receives all your data, wheter it's you banking details or any other >>confidential information<<.

How to prevent:
Cybersecurity is important aspect of our daily life, pay attention to >>installed software<< or any >>new software or connections<< which ask to install certificates.
